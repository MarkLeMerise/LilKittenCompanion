## How to use
This helper will craft, hunt, and praise on a regular interval (indicated by timers).

1. Click any name or icon to adjust the interval. The default is 4 minutes.
1. Use the play/pause buttons (‚ñ∂Ô∏è/‚è∏) to start and stop the helpers.
1. ???
1. Profit!

> ‚òÑÔ∏è Once started, the "sky" task, which automatically observes astronomical events, will Just Work (no need to ever stop it). However, it becomes obsolete once starcharts are generated automatically.

## Motivation
Build an auto-clicker that did nothing more than the very basics: crafting, hunting, and praising. Eliminiate the mind-numbing clicks while still leaving the main direction to the player. Yes, these tasks can now be somewhat done in-game via engineers but let's be honest, that's just a chunk of your workforce that could be doing other things.

It is up to you to coordinate the timing of the tasks to maximize resource usage and production.
